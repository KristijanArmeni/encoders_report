	abstract = {This dataset, colloquially known as the Mother Of Unification Studies (MOUS) dataset, contains multimodal neuroimaging data that has been acquired from 204 healthy human subjects. The neuroimaging protocol consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to derive information at high spatial resolution about brain anatomy and structural connections, and functional data during task, and at rest. In addition, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to obtain high temporal resolution electrophysiological measurements during task, and at rest. All subjects performed a language task, during which they processed linguistic utterances that either consisted of normal or scrambled sentences. Half of the subjects were reading the stimuli, the other half listened to the stimuli. The resting state measurements consisted of 5 minutes eyes-open for the MEG and 7 minutes eyes-closed for fMRI. The neuroimaging data, as well as the information about the experimental events are shared according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. This unprecedented neuroimaging language data collection allows for the investigation of various aspects of the neurobiological correlates of language.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade fMRI researchers have developed increasingly sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in BOLD activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear classification, a simple technique for decoding information about experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based encoding model, which describes the information about the stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations: encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in practice these two operations are often confused, and their respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear. Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate some of the most common questions about how information is represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding model can in principle provide a complete functional description of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is much more difficult to derive an encoding model from a decoding model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.},

            Recently, cognitive neuroscientists have increasingly studied the brain responses to narratives. At the same time, we are witnessing exciting developments in natural language processing where large-scale neural network models can be used to instantiate cognitive hypotheses in narrative processing. Yet, they learn from text alone and we lack ways of incorporating biological constraints during training. To mitigate this gap, we provide a narrative comprehension magnetoencephalography (MEG) data resource that can be used to train neural network models directly on brain data. We recorded from 3 participants, 10 separate recording hour-long sessions each, while they listened to audiobooks in English. After story listening, participants answered short questions about their experience. To minimize head movement, the participants wore MEG-compatible head casts, which immobilized their head position during recording. We report a basic evoked-response analysis showing that the responses accurately localize to primary auditory areas. The responses are robust and conserved across 10 sessions for every participant. We also provide usage notes and briefly outline possible future uses of the resource.},

These sub-processes have traditionally been studied using separate neuroimaging experiments that attempt to isolate specific effects of interest. More recently it has become possible to study all stages of language comprehension in a single neuroimaging experiment using narrative natural language stimuli. The resulting data are richly varied at every level, enabling analyses that can probe everything from spectral representations to high-level representations of semantic meaning. We provide a dataset containing BOLD fMRI responses recorded while 8 participants each listened to 27 complete, natural, narrative stories ({\textasciitilde}6 hours). This dataset includes pre-processed and raw MRIs, as well as hand-constructed 3D cortical surfaces for each participant. To address the challenges of analyzing naturalistic data, this dataset is accompanied by a python library containing basic code for creating voxelwise encoding models.

	abstract = {Loss of speech after paralysis is devastating, but circumventing motor-pathway injury by directly decoding speech from intact cortical activity has the potential to restore natural communication and self-expression. Recent discoveries have defined how key features of speech production are facilitated by the coordinated activity of vocal-tract articulatory and motor-planning cortical representations. In this Review, we highlight such progress and how it has led to successful speech decoding, first in individuals implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical epilepsy monitoring and subsequently in individuals with paralysis as part of early feasibility clinical trials to restore speech. We discuss high-spatiotemporal-resolution neural interfaces and the adaptation of state-of-the-art speech computational algorithms that have driven rapid and substantial progress in decoding neural activity into text, audible speech, and facial movements. Although restoring natural speech is a long-term goal, speech neuroprostheses already have performance levels that surpass communication rates offered by current assistive-communication technology. Given this accelerated rate of progress in the field, we propose key evaluation metrics for speed and accuracy, among others, to help standardize across studies. We finish by highlighting several directions to more fully explore the multidimensional feature space of speech and language, which will continue to accelerate progress towards a clinically viable speech neuroprosthesis.},

Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2–5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility is widely considered to be an essential requirement of the scientific process. However, a number of serious concerns have been raised recently, questioning whether today’s computational work is adequately reproducible. In principle, it should be possible to specify a computation to sufficient detail that anyone should be able to reproduce it exactly. But in practice, there are fundamental, technical, and social barriers to doing so. The many objectives and meanings of reproducibility are discussed within the context of scientific computing. Technical barriers to reproducibility are described, extant approaches surveyed, and open areas of research are identified.},

	abstract = {Reproducible research---by its many names---has come to be regarded as a key concern across disciplines and stakeholder groups. Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},
