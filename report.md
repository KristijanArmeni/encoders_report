title: "Executable science: Research Software Engineering Practices for Replicating Neuroscience Findings"
short_title: Executable science
abstract: |
  Computational approaches are central to deriving insights in modern science. In this interdisciplinary convergence, researchers are increasingly expected to share research code and data along with published results. However, with software engineering practices still predominantly an overlooked component in research, it remains unclear whether sharing data and code alone is sufficient for reproducibility in practice. We set out to reproduce and replicate evaluation results of a publicly available human neuroimaging dataset recorded when participants listened to short stories. Using the code and data shared with the paper, we predicted the brain activity of the participants with semantic embeddings of words in stories. We successfully reproduced the original results, showing that model performance improved with more training data. However, when we replicated the analysis with our own code, the model's performance was much lower than reported in the paper. We traced this difference to the discrepancy between method description and its implementation in shared code. While access to original code proved crucial for our ability to replicate the results, barriers such as a complex code structure and insufficient documentation hindered our progress. We argue that software engineering practices are essential for reproducible and reusable research. We discuss components of our workflow and specific practices that effectively mitigate barriers to reproducibility.

# Introduction

Computational methods are an indispensable part of contemporary science. For example, cognitive computational neuroscience is a nascent discipline using computational models to investigate the brain's representations, algorithms, and mechanisms underlying human intelligent behavior in healthy and clinical populations [@kriegeskorte_cognitive_2018; @naselaris_cognitive_2018]. As computational techniques become central to scientific discovery, the ability of independent research teams to reproduce and replicate published work has been recognized as a standard for evaluating the reliability of scientific findings [@claerbout_electronic_1992; @donoho_invitation_2010; @peng_reproducible_2009]. Researchers are now strongly encouraged to share open and reproducible research data, code, and documentation alongside written reports [@peng_reproducible_2011; @pineau_improving_2021; @jwa_spectrum_2022; @nelson_ensuring_2022], a trend also reflected in cognitive computational neuroscience [@sejnowski_putting_2014; @poldrack_making_2014; @gorgolewski_brain_2016; @poldrack_scanning_2017; @botvinik-nezer_reproducibility_2023; @de_vries_sharing_2023]. Despite this progress, achieving computational reproducibility in research remains a significant practical challenge, due to the increasing complexity of both data and analytical methods, as well as ethical and legal constraints [@open_science_collaboration_estimating_2015; @botvinik-nezer_variability_2020; @jwa_spectrum_2022; @hardwicke_analytic_2021; @xiong_state_2023; @barba_path_2024].

While there is growing momentum toward sharing research artifacts such as data and code, making them available does not guarantee reproducibility [@mckiernan_policy_2023]. To be truly reproducible, research artifacts must also be reusable, readable, and resilient [@connolly_software_2023].
Reproduction efforts can falter when artifacts are incomplete or contain errors -- such as missing data or faulty scripts [@pimentel_large-scale_2019; @hardwicke_analytic_2021; @nguyen_are_2025] -- or when the documentation is sparse or unclear, making it difficult to rerun analyses with the provided data [@xiong_state_2023].
In contrast, the software engineering community has long developed best practices for creating robust and reusable general-purpose artifacts [e.g., @thomas_pragmatic_2020; @beck_manifesto_2001; @martin_clean_2012; @washizaki_guide_2024].
However, these practices are not always directly applicable to research settings, where the scope of engineering needs varies from standalone analysis scripts to domain-specific research software tools [@balaban_ten_2021; @connolly_software_2023]. Given that much of scientific research is conducted within relatively small, independent teams, a central question arises: what software practices and open-source tools are best suited to support reproducible research?

Here, we share our experience and lessons learned from a small-scale reproducibility project in an academic neuroscience lab. We set out to reproduce and replicate the evaluation of predictive models on a publicly available fMRI dataset, which demonstrated that increasing the amount of training data improved average performance in predicting brain activity at the individual participant level [@lebel_natural_2023]. We conducted three complementary experiments: i) a **reproduction** experiment using the original shared data and code, ii) a **replication** experiment using the shared data but re-implementing the analysis with our own code, and iii) an **extension** experiment using the shared data in a novel analysis not reported in the original paper.

The main contributions of our work are:

- We successfully reproduced the original results using the shared data and code.
- We identified several challenges when replicating the analysis with our own implementation.
- We describe components of our reproducible workflow and review software engineering practices that can facilitate reproducible research.

# Methods

In what follows, we provide a high-level overview of the methodology, the data used, and the analysis design for our experiments following the original experiment and dataset [@lebel_natural_2023].

## Encoding models

A central goal in computational neuroscience is to test hypotheses about the computations and representations the brain uses to process information. Encoding models address this goal by quantifying the relationship between features of a stimulus and the corresponding neural responses to the same stimulus.

In practice, machine learning methods are often used to extract relevant stimulus features (e.g., semantic, visual, or acoustic), which are then used in statistical models (typically linear regression [@ivanova_beyond_2022]) to predict neural activity [@naselaris_encoding_2011]. By comparing the predictive performance of different encoding models (e.g., from different stimulus features across different brain areas), researchers can draw inferences about the spatial and temporal organization of brain function [@kriegeskorte_interpreting_2019; doerig_neuroconnectionist_2023]. Encoding models are also foundational for brain-computer interfaces, including clinical applications such as speech prostheses, which aim to reconstruct intended speech from recorded brain activity [@silva_speech_2024].

Formally, an encoding model estimates a function that maps stimulus features $\textbf{X}$ to brain responses $\textbf{Y}$. The model typically takes a linear form:

```{math}
\hat{\textbf{Y}} = \textbf{X} \hat{\textbf{W}}
```

where {math}`\hat{\textbf{Y}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N}` denotes predicted brain responses across $T$ time points and $N$ voxels, and {math}`\textbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times D}` contains $D$-dimensional stimulus features. The weight matrix {math}`\hat{\textbf{W}} \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times N}` captures the contribution of each feature dimension to each voxelâ€™s activity.

Model estimation involves fitting $\hat{\textbf{W}}$ to predict brain activity $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{\text{train}}$ from features $\textbf{X}_{\text{train}}$ using statistical methods such as ridge regression. Model performance is then evaluated on held-out test data by comparing predicted brain activity $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{\textsf{test}}$ to observed brain activity $\textbf{Y}_{\textsf{test}}$ using a scoring function such as Pearson correlation: $r = \textsf{correlation}(\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{\textsf{test}}, \textbf{Y}_{\textsf{test}})$.

:::{glossary}
fMRI
: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes of oxygenated blood flow. It is commonly used to study brain function by capturing dynamic activity signals across the whole brain.

BOLD  
: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent or BOLD is the signal measured in fMRI that reflects changes in the concentration of oxygenated versus deoxygenated blood. Neural activity leads to localized changes in blood flow and oxygenation, which can be detected as BOLD signal fluctuations.

TR
: Time-to-repeat (TR) is the time interval between successive measurements of the same slice or volume in fMRI. It determines the temporal resolution of the acquired data, typically ranging from 0.5 to 3 seconds.

Voxel
: The smallest unit of measurement in fMRI data, representing a fixed region of brain tissue in three-dimensional space. Each voxel contains a summary signal that reflects the average activity within that region, typically encompassing thousands of neurons.

:::

## Dataset

The publicly available fMRI dataset provided by @lebel_natural_2023 recorded blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals while participants listened to 27 natural narrative stories.
The dataset is available via the OpenNeuro repository[^openneuro].

[^openneuro]: https://openneuro.org/

### Preprocessed fMRI responses ({math}`\textbf{Y}_{fmri}`)

Because the focus of our work was on encoding models, we chose to use the preprocessed fMRI data provided by @lebel_natural_2023.
As a result, our reproducibility efforts did not involve preprocessing of raw fMRI data, which includes steps such as motion correction, cross-run alignment, and temporal filtering.
We limited our analysis to a subset of three participants (`S01`, `S02`, `S03`) because they showed the highest signal quality and highest final performance in the original paper.
We reasoned that this minimal subset of data would be sufficient to evaluate the reproducibility and replicability of the modeling results.

We accessed the data using the DataLad data management tool [@halchenko_datalad_2021], as recommended by @lebel_natural_2023.
Time series were available as `.h5p` files for each participant and each story. Following the original report, the first 10 seconds (5 {term}`TR`s) of each story were trimmed to remove the 10-second silence period before the story began.

**Hemodynamic response estimation**  
The fMRI BOLD responses are thought to represent temporally delayed (on the scale of seconds) and slowly fluctuating components of the underlying local neural activity [@logothetis_underpinnings_2003]. To account for this delayed response, predictor features for timepoint {math}`t` were constructed by concatenating stimulus features from time points {math}`t - 1` to {math}`t - 4` ({math}`n_{\text{delay}}=4`). For timepoints where {math}`t-k<0`, zero vectors were used as padding. This resulted in a predictor matrix {math}`X \in \mathbb{R}^{T\times 4D}`. Although this increases computational cost, it enables the regression model to capture the shape of the hemodynamic response function [@boynton_linear_1996] underlying the BOLD signal.


## Predictors

### Semantic predictor ({math}`\textbf{X}_{\textsf{semantic}}`)

To model brain activity related to aspects of linguistic meaning understanding during story listening, @lebel_natural_2023 used word embeddings --- high-dimensional vectors capturing distributional semantic properties of words based on their co-occurrences in large collections of text [@clark_vector_2015].

**Extracting word embeddings and timings**  
For each word in the story, we extracted its precomputed 985-dimensional embedding vector [@huth_natural_2016] from the {math}`\textsf{english1000sm.hf5}`[^english1000sm] data matrix (a lookup table) provided by @lebel_natural_2023 and available in the OpenNeuro repository. Words not present in the vocabulary were assigned a zero vector. For every story, this yielded a {math}`\hat{\textbf{X}}_{\textsf{semantic}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\text{words}} \times 985}` matrix of word embeddings for each story where {math}`N_{\text{words}}` are all individual words in a story. The onset and offset times (in seconds) of words were extracted from {math}`\textsf{*.TextGrid}` annotation files[^textgrid] provided with the original dataset.

[^english1000sm]: https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds003020/blob/main/derivative/english1000sm.hf5

[^textgrid]: These are structured .txt files that are used with the Praat software for acoustic analysis (https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)

**Aligning word embeddings with fMRI signal**  
The fMRI BOLD signal was sampled at regular intervals (repetition time, or TR = 2s). To compute a stimulus matrix {math}`\hat{\textbf{X}}_{\textsf{semantic}}` that matched the sampling rate of the BOLD data, following @lebel_natural_2023, we first constructed an array of word times {math}`T^{\text{word}}` by assigning each word a time half-way between its onset and offset time. This was used to transform the embedding matrix (which was at discrete word times) into a continuous-time representation. This representation is zero at all timepoints except for the middle of each word {math}`T^{\text{word}}`, where it is equal to the embedding vector of the word. We then convolved this signal with a Lanczos kernel (with parameter {math}`a=3` and {math}`f_{\text{cutoff}}=0.25` Hz) to smooth the embeddings over time and mitigate high-frequency noise. Finally, we resampled the signal half-way between the TR times of the fMRI data to create the feature matrix used for regression, {math}`\textbf{X}_{\textsf{semantic}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\text{TRs}} \times N^{\text{dim}}}`.

### Sensory predictor ({math}`\textbf{X}_{\textsf{sensory}}`)

To benchmark the predictive performance of our semantic predictor, we decided to develop an additional, simpler encoding model based on acoustic properties of the stories (not reported in the original work by @lebel_natural_2023).
The audio envelope was computed by taking the absolute value of the hilbert-transformed wavfile data.
For each story, the envelope was trimmed at the end by dropping the 10 beginning and final seconds.
The trimmed envelope was then downsampled to the sampling frequency of the fMRI data.

## Ridge regression

To fit a penalized ridge regression model, we used the scikit-learn library [@pedregosa_scikit-learn:_2011], which is a mature library for machine learning with a large user-base and community support.
Specifically, we used the `RidgeCV()` class which performs a leave-one-out cross-validation to select the best value of the {math}`\alpha` hyperparameter for each target variable (i.e. brain activity time courses in each voxel) prior to fitting the model.
We set the possible hyperparamater values to {math}`\alpha \in` `np.logspace(1, 3, 10)` as in the original report [@lebel_natural_2023].
The {math}`\alpha` value that resulted in the highest product-moment correlation coefficient then was used by `RidgeCV()` as the hyperparameter value to fit the model.

## Evaluation

### Cross-validation

Cross-validation was performed at the story level to ensure the independence of training and test data.
Specifically, to construct the training set, we randomly sampled without replacement a subset of {math}`N^{\text{train size}}` stories from the {math}`N^{\text{total stories}} = 26` training set pool and held out one constant story (*Where there's smoke*) as the test dataset in each fold.
This random sampling process was repeated {math}`N^{\text{repeat}} = 15` times, with a new selection of training stories from {math}`N^{\text{total stories}}` in each iteration as described in the original report [@lebel_natural_2023].
To evaluate the effect of training set size on model performance, we varied {math}`N^{\text{train size}} \in \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25\}`.

The predictor features for the training and test set were z-scored prior to the regression.
The normalization parameters for z-scoring were only computed from the training set.
This prevented any statistical information leaking from the test data into our evaluation procedure, maintaining the integrity of the cross-validation procedure.

### Performance metrics

The performance of the encoding model was quantified by calculating the Pearson correlation between the observed BOLD responses and the predicted BOLD responses on the held-out test story.
Following @lebel_natural_2023 we averaged the encoding model's performance across 15 repetitions. This allows for a more reliable estimate thereby reducing the risk of performance being biased by any particular split of the data.

# Results

## Reproduction experiment

We used the original data and code to reproduce the original experimental results.
The code provided the core regression component, but lacked the capability to reproduce the figures.
Thus, we ported the code into our own code base.
To compute the results, we retained the default parameters, except for parameters `nboots`, `chunklen`, and `nchunk`[^parameters] which were set to 20, 10, and 10, respectively (see Table [](#tab:regression_parameters)).

[^parameters]: For an explanation of the parameters see the "Code" section of the original paper [@lebel_natural_2023].

**We successfully reproduced published results.** In [](#main_figure)[^icons_attribution], we show the results of our reproduction experiment (panel B) next to originally published figures (panel A).
Using the shared code and data for the three best performing participants (`S01`, `S02`, `S03`), we were able to reproduce the reported results.
As in the published results, the highest performing participant was `S03` with the highest average test-set correlation at {math}`r \approx 0.08`, followed by `S02` at {math}`\approx 0.07`, and `S01` at {math}`\approx 0.06`.

**Model performance increased with larger training dataset sizes.**
Our reproduction further confirmed that model performance depends on the amount of training data available for each participant.
For the best performing model, performance nearly tripled (from average correlation about 0.03 to 0.09) between the smallest ({math}`N^{\text{stories}} = 1`) and the largest ({math}`N^{\text{stories}} = 25`) training set size.

**Highest performance in the brain areas comprised the language network.** 
The brain language network consists of multiple areas on the left and right sides behind the temples (temporal cortices), the front (frontal cortex) and the upper middle part (parietal cortex) [@friederici_language_2013; @hagoort_neurobiology_2019; @fedorenko_language_2024].
Breaking down the average performance across the brain for each voxel for the best performing model (for participant `S02` at {math}`N^{\text{stories}} = 25`, [](#main_figure), panel E), we found, in line with the original report, that the strongest performance was achieved in the left temporal cortex with a peak correlation of about 0.5, followed by areas in the frontal and parietal cortices.

## Replication experiment

**We replicated the spatial and training set size effects, but not the effect size.** 
The results for model performance on example subject are shown in [](#main_figure), Panel C.
Overall, we managed to reproduce the training set size effects and the broader spatial brain patterns.
In terms of spatial patterns, the best performing voxels were found in the bilateral temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices which is broadly in line with the spatial patterns in the original report and our replication.
As in the original report, our reproduction results broadly confirmed that the model showed better performance on the held-out story if trained on a larger set containing more training stories.
However, the effect size obtained with our reproduction pipeline was almost half the size of the original results.
Our best performing model did not go beyond average performance of 0.05 versus 0.09 for the best performing model in the original report and replication.
That is, our models capture the language-related brain activity in the relevant brain areas, but they underperformed compared with the original results.

### Why did replication results diverge?

To assess the discrepancy between the reproduction and replication results, we incorporated the regression function from the original codebase into our replication pipeline ([](#figure_patching), panels A & B).
This modification substantially improved model performance and successfully recovered the results reported in the original paper and reproduction experiment ([](#figure_patching), Panels C & D).
Although we did not formally test the contributions of differences between implementations, we identified two crucial distinctions in the original code's regression approach that likely explain the performance improvement: 1) the SVD-based implementation explicitly removed components of the regressor matrix with small singular values; 2) instead of standard k-fold cross-validation, a chunking with bootstrapping strategy [@huth_natural_2016] was employed for hyperparameter optimization.

```{figure} fig/manuscript_figures/figure2-patching.svg
:label: figure_patching
:width: 60%

Replication results were improved after patching our code with regression implementation from @lebel_natural_2023. **A)** The pipeline of our replication used the regression function in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html) [@pedregosa_scikit-learn:_2011]. **B)** The 'patched' pipeline used the regression function from [Lebel et al.](https://github.com/HuthLab/deep-fMRI-dataset/blob/master/encoding/ridge_utils/ridge.py) **C & D:** Semantic encoding model performance (whole brain average) per participant with increasing training set sizes. Each line shows mean performance (shaded areas show standard error of the mean across 15 repetitions).
```

## Extension: Sensory encoding model

One of the core motivations behind reproducible computational research is that it should, in principle, allow researchers to easily extend and build on the shared work.
To further benchmark our replication pipeline, we explored the feasibility of performing a small but meaningful extension to the original semantic encoding model.
Processing of semantic features in language input is a high-level cognitive process that engages distributed brain networks [@binder_where_2009; @huth_natural_2016].
As a contrast, we implemented a simpler encoding model based solely on a single one-dimensional acoustic feature of the stimulus, namely, instantaneous fluctuations of the auditory envelope which we termed sensory model.

In [](#figure_extension) we report the results of the sensory model.
Compared to the semantic model, it captured activity in a more restricted set of brain areas, with peak performance localized to the auditory cortex (AC) â€“ a sensory area involved in early-stage auditory processing.
This observation is broadly consistent with prior work, which has repeatedly shown that activity in auditory cortical regions is strongly modulated by low-level acoustic features, while higher-order language processing recruits a more extensive group of regions including temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices [@hickok_cortical_2007].

```{figure} fig/manuscript_figures/figure3-extension.svg
:label: figure_extension

Sensory model encoding performance showed a narrower set of regions compared to the semantic model. **A)** Acoustic encoding model performance for each participant with increasing training set size (intact and shuffled predictors, shaded areas show standard error of the mean across 15 repetitions). **B)** Voxel-specific performance for `S02`.

# Discussion

Reproducible computational science ensures scientific integrity and allows researchers to efficiently build upon past work.
Here, we report the results of a reproduction and replication project in computational neuroscience, a scientific discipline with computational techniques at its core [@kriegeskorte_cognitive_2018].
We set out to reproduce and replicate evaluation results of a publicly available neuroimaging dataset recorded while participants listened to short stories [@lebel_natural_2023].
Using the code shared with the paper, we reproduced the results showing that predicting brain activity with semantic embeddings of words in stories improved with increasing size of training datasets in each participant.
When attempting to replicate the results by implementing the original analysis with our own code, our model performance was much lower than the published results.
Accessing the original code, we were able to confirm that the discrepancy was due to the differences in implementation of the regression function.

## Reproduction was largely frictionless, replication was not

There were several examples of good practices that made our reproduction and replications attempts easier.First, Lebel et al [@lebel_natural_2023], distributed their dataset through a dedicated repository for data sharing [@markiewicz_openneuro_2021] and structured the dataset following a domain-specific community standard [@poldrack_making_2014] which made it possible to use a data management software [@halchenko_datalad_2021] for accessing it.
While this might appear a trivial note given that the original work is a dataset descriptor with data sharing as it core objective, it warrants an emphasis as its benefits apply to any empirical work. Specifically, their approach made it easy for us to access the dataset programmatically when building the pipeline (e.g. writing a single script for downloading the data needed in our experiments as opposed to accessing the data interactively).
This highlights the importance of data management infrastructure and tools in writing reproducible research code.

Second, the authors provided cursory documentation and instructions on how to use their code for reproducing the results.
While some elements of the shared code that would have been helpful were missing, for example the scripts used for executing the original analyses and the code that produced the figures, the information provided was nevertheless sufficient for us to be able to reproduce their full analysis on the three best participants.
In addition, the provided code was modular, with specific analysis steps being implemented as separate routines (for example, the regression module contained the regression fitting functions etc.), making porting specific modules to our code easy and convenient. 
Analyses in computational neuroscience frequently require custom implementations and workflows which makes a single-analysis-script approach impractical, which is customary in computational research [@balaban_ten_2021]. Navigating the code without basic documentation and sensible organization would have rendered replication much more effortful.

Whereas reproducing the results was mostly achievable, replicating the work with our own code and adapting it for a novel experiment was not without friction.
This came to the fore once we started building and evaluating our replication pipeline from the descriptions in the report.
For example, when implementing the encoding model, we decided to use a standard machine learning library that conveniently implements ridge regression fitting routines, as it was no apparent from the original paper alone to us which kind of ridge regression was needed.
Despite attempting to exactly match the hyperparameter selection, cross-validation scheme, and scoring functions, our encoding models kept underperforming relative to published results.
Until we patched our pipeline with the original regression functions, it was unclear just which aspect of our pipeline was causing lower performance.
Thus, without the shared code it would have been near impossible for us to troubleshoot our process on the basis of the published report alone. 

As another case in point, we encountered challenges when attempting to build on the work and perform a nominally straightforward extension of the original experiment by building an encoding model based on the audio envelope of the stimuli.
Whereas the process to temporally align word embeddings and brain data was documented, following the same recipe to align the shared auditory stimuli and brain signal resulted in inconsistencies in the sizes of the to-be-aligned data arrays.
We were left to perform our best guess as to the proper alignment by triangulating between stimulus length and number of samples, significantly increasing the effort for an otherwise straightforward extension.

## Tallying software engineering practices for reproducibility in neuroscience

Informed by our reproducibility and replication experience, we argue that software engineering practices, such as code documentation, code review, version control, and code testing, among others, are essential in mitigating barriers to reproducibility beyond what is achievable with data and code sharing alone.
In doing so, we rejoin other scientists and software engineers in calling for software engineering maturity in research [@wilson_wheres_2006; @sandve_ten_2013; @wilson_best_2014; @wilson_good_2017; @storer_bridging_2017; @balaban_ten_2021; @barba_path_2024; @johnson_sciops_2024].
While the benefits conferred by software engineering practices might appear uncontentious _in principle_, adoption of any new practice, be it for an individual or in a larger community, is far from straightforward _in practice_.
Absent appropriate incentives, infrastructure and norms, adopting a new skill or behavior includes a perceived cost (e.g. the time it takes to acquire a new skill) which can be a significant deterrent to adoption [@nosek_strategy_2019; @armeni_towards_2021].
Software engineering practices are no exception: practices will differ in terms of how difficult they are to adopt (i.e., technical overhead required), the time it takes to apply the practice, and the gain they bring for the researcher or the team adopting them.

:::{table}
:label: practices_table
![](#nb_practices_table)

Our tally of software engineering practices in research with respect to reproducibility gains (the 3R framework by @connolly_software_2023), possible costs, and example tools we adopted.
:::

Table [](#practices_table) summarizes our own experience in adopting some of the research software practices, how we believe they mitigate the barriers to reproducibility, and their possible costs.
In tallying the reproducibility gains, we follow the framework of 3Rs for academic research software proposed by Connolly et al.: research code should be readable, reusable, and resilient [@connolly_software_2023].
In terms of possible costs, "technical overhead" in Table [](#practices_table) refers to the degree of novel technical expertise required to adopt a practice.
For example, even for someone who regularly writes analysis code, code packaging requires learning the packaging tools, configuration options, the package publishing ecosystem,  etc.
``Time investment'', on the other hand, refers to the amount of time it takes to learn and subsequently apply a practice, once learned.[^practice_costs]

[^practice_costs]: While these two aspects are certainly positively correlated to a significant extent, a practice can require little technical overhead, while still representing non-negligible time investment (e.g. writing documentation) or vice-versa (e.g. code packaging, which is set up only once, but requires dedicated technical know-how).

Research software specifically can vary in scope on a spectrum between a standalone analysis script and up to a mature software project used by a larger research community [@connolly_software_2023].
Research software in computational neuroscience typically falls in between the two extremes.
Computational neuroscience is is a diverse discipline in terms of the scale of investigations (e.g., ranging from single-neuron to whole-brain recordings) and the type of measurements used (e.g., static anatomical images, dynamic multi channel activity over time, or a combination of different data modalities) [@sejnowski_putting_2014].
What the analyses have in common, however, is that they are composed of several stages (e.g., preprocessing, model fitting, statistical inference, visualization)[@gilmore_progress_2017] such that they frequently require custom routines and workflows [@balaban_ten_2021].
What aspects of software engineering practices can specifically benefit computational reproducibility in human neuroscience?

**Increasing transparency and readability: Documentation, code formatting, and code review.** Our replication experience showed that methodological details described in the published report were insufficient in detail and our success hinged on our ability to reverse engineer the procedures with the help of shared code.
Details matter: given the complexity of analytical pipelines in computational neuroscience, even a nominally small analytical deviation can have large cumulative effects on results [@carp_secret_2012; @gilmore_progress_2017; @poldrack_scanning_2017; @errington_challenges_2021].
Insufficient reporting standards in fMRI research have been confirmed in large-scale analyses of published work [@carp_secret_2012; @guo_reporting_2014; @poldrack_scanning_2017] and in other fields such as cancer biology [@errington_challenges_2021].
Our first set of recommended practices thus centers on code transparency and readability.

Sufficiently documented code, for example inline comments and function docstrings, significantly boosted our understanding of its purpose and thus our ability to reuse it in replication experiments.
Conversely, the lack of such documentation made even the well-structured code difficult to understand and compelled us to perform a line-by-line walkthrough in order to understand the operations on different variables.
Given the modular nature of shared code in neuroscience [@gilmore_progress_2017], we argue that, apart from inline comments and cursory mentions in papers, all shared code should minimally contain full docstrings for functions and classes and illustrative guides in how they can be invoked.
This is particularly necessary for any custom in-house developed code.
We found that adopting automatic documentation frameworks such as MkDocstrings[^mkdocstrings] (see [](#fig:workflow)) which parses docstrings in code, greatly improved our ability to review documentation.

Another obvious practice to boost code clarity is code review: auditing the code for style, quality, and accuracy by peers or developers other than the authors [@ackerman_software_1989; @bacchelli_expectations_2013].
Apart from quality control, code review brings other important benefits such as increased author confidence, collegiality, and cross-team learning [@vable_code_2021; @rokem_ten_2024].
We conducted code reviews in the form of brief code walkthroughs after every meeting.
We found that incremental adoption was crucial.
For example, while reviewing entire research code could be burdensome, reviewing smaller code chunks, soon after they were implemented, was very doable, improved code clarity, and allowed us to catch mistakes early.
Like documentation, code review is a relatively straightforward practice to adopt insofar that it requires minimal to no technical overhead.
While it can be a subset of code review, we include code formatting as a standalone practice which can be adopted without doing a code review (e.g. using dedicated tools such as linters).

**Increasing resilience and reuse: Version control, packaging, and testing.** We view version control, packaging, and code testing as practices that require greater investment in familiarity with technical tools and possibly steeper learning curves. 
Version control, a systematic way of recording changes made to files over time [@community_turing_2022], is a standard practice in software engineering. 
While version control does not directly contribute to readability or reusability (in the sense that even extensively versioned code may not be re-executable), it is essential in making the computational research process resilient --- in the event of catastrophic changes, current state of files can be reverted to a previous state. 
We adopted version control for the entire project duration as all team members were already regular users of version control.
We adopted a simple collaborative workflow where we all had write access to a joint remote GitHub repository.
This allowed us to flexibly employ branching, issues, pull requests etc. practices that we started using more often with as the project matured.

Every reproducible research code, if it is to be reused by peers must be distributable.
Making research software reusable is considered part of the FAIR principles of research software [@chue_hong_fair_2022]. Reusable code is easy to install and setup, which facilitates adoption and reuse [@ma_human_2024]. 
Depending on complexity, research code can be made reusable in various ways [@community_turing_2022], one option is to distribute it as an installable _package_: a collection containing the code to be installed, specification of required dependencies, and any software metadata (e.g., author information, project description, etc.). 
In practice, packaging means organizing your code following an expected directory structure and file naming conventions [@wasser_pyopenscipython-package-guide_2024].

In addition to facilitating code reuse across different users, one of the advantages of installable code is that your code can be reused across your projects. 
That turned out to be a crucial design factor in our reproducible workflow, where we wrapped our figure-making code into separate functions within the package. 
These functions are reused in a jupyter notebook (part of a separate repository) which is embedded in the report authored with MyST Markdown (see [](#fig:workflow) and code in [](#lst:plot)). 
The separation between analysis code (package) and its subsequent usage (e.g., in computational notebook, report) follows the principle of modular code design, also known as *do-not-repeat-yourself* (DRY) principle [@wilson_good_2017]. 
Most programming languages come with dedicated packaging managers [@alser_packaging_2024]. 
Whereas Python packaging ecosystem is sometimes perceived as unwieldy[^xkcd_packaging], we found that modern packaging tools, for example Poetry[^poetry] and uv[^uv], were straightforward to use, did not incur substantial technical overhead, and required only short time investment (e.g., {math}`\sim 60` mins).

[^xkcd_packaging]: https://xkcd.com/1987
[^poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/
[^uv]: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

Finally, possibly the most extensive practice we include on our list is code testing. 
Code testing is a process of writing dedicated routines that test specific parts of code or entire workflows for accuracy and syntactic correctness. 
Yet, while testing in pure software development is a mature discipline and provides the broadest reproducibility benefits, research code comes with its own specific testing considerations and challenges [@eisty_testing_2025]. 
To highlight just two, analysis code in empirical research depends on data which can contain inconsistencies and exceptions making it challenging to write a single test covering all exceptions. 
In addition, in neuroscience the datasets tend to be large (on the orders of 10s of gigabytes) and given the need for tests to be performed frequently, dedicated test datasets would need to be created in order to keep the tests lightweight. 
Second, the research process is iterative (e.g., output of one analysis stage shapes the analysis at the next stage) and the boundaries between the development and deployment phases are frequently blurry [@vliet_seven_2020], leading to challenging testing decisions and frequent need for updating the test suite. 
In contrast, developing testing code demands upfront knowledge of requirements and substantial investment of time, neither of which are plentiful in neuroscience.
Testing is the final software engineering practice on our list for a reason; we only started writing limited unit tests and basic package installation tests via PyTest and GitHub actions later in the project phase, once the workflows matured and required less frequent changes.

## Towards reproducible scientific publishing workflows

[](#figure_workflow) shows a high-level overview of our adopted code, documentation, and publishing workflow. It shows three main streams: i) packaged code and documentation, ii) computation, storage, and archiving, and iii) computational report.
This architecture allows research code (e.g., analysis and plotting scripts) to be developed and versioned in one place and independently of the deployment (HPC) and the publishing streams.
The workflow is semi-automatic. For example, documentation and report are deployed and rebuilt automatically upon changes to repositories via GitHub actions and GitHub Pages. 
However, if analyses change, the researcher must redeploy the jobs on the computing cluster, download the new results, re-execute the report pipeline, and update the remote repositories.

A schematic overview of our software development and publishing workflow.
:::

**Package and documentation** The analysis package contains the separate `.py` modules corresponding to distinct analysis stages (e.g., `data.py` for loading the data, `regression.py` for model fitting, etc.) which provide the relevant functions (e.g., `data.load_fmri`, `regression.ridge_regression`, etc.). 
The analysis code is locally installable as a python package (via  Poetry[^poetry]) meaning that after downloading, the user can install the code and dependencies, for example using either `poetry install` or via `pip install -e .`.
The code was versioned using git and hosted on GitHub, licensed with permissive MIT License. 

We used MkDocs[^mkdocs] to parse the contents or the `./docs` folder in the project repository and to render the documentation website.
We used MkDocstrings extension that automatically parsed analysis code docstrings and included it as part of the documentation website.
The documentation site was published via GitHub Pages and set to redeploy automatically upon updates to the code repository via a GitHub actions.

:caption: Example usage of packaged research code. The code for figures from the analysis package is imported and exectued in a jupyter notebook. The user is expected to have downloaded precomputed data (model scores) beforehand. The notebook cell rendering the figure is labeled and the figure can be reused in a MyST interactive report.

# import code for figures from the package
from encoders.plots import make_brain_figure

#| label:brainfig
fig = make_brain_figure(
    data_folder="/path/to/downloaded/data"
)

:::

**Data and computation** All our analyses were deployed on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.
Because the encoding models are fit across the entire brain (resulting in $\approx10^3$ target variables in a regression model) using high-dimensional predictors (e.g., frequently several hundred dimensions), they require sufficiently powered computing infrastructure.
For example, for the models with the largest training datasets size, we requested 180 gigabytes of memory (RAM).
This required a separate deployment stream and precluded, for example, executing all the analyses in an interactive jupyter notebook session.

**Publishing** A separate repository was used to visualize the results and publish an interactive research report using the MyST Markdown[^mystmd] framework [@rowan_cockett_jupyter-bookmystmd_2025].
MyST allows users to author a computational report in a markdown file, providing all the functionality for technical writing (e.g., citations, cross-references, math rendering, etc.).
A report file can be paired with a jupyter notebook that contains cells with results figures.
The repository contains three files: the MyST configuration file (`myst.yaml`), a jupyter notebook rendering the figures (`figures.ipynb`), and a markdown file containing the actual report (`report.md`).
Crucially, because the analysis code is modular and packaged, the jupyter notebook imports the `plots.py` module and reuses the code that creates the figures (see [](#code_example)), they are can be referenced and reused in the markdown report by the MyST parser.

## Limitations

**End-to-end reproducibility.** From the perspective of reproducibility, our workflow falls short in certain respects.
The compute and storage resources needed to fit the encoding models require access to HPC clusters, which not all research institutions or individual researchers have access to.
While we documented the HPC scripts that a researcher would need to re-execute the analyses, the only part of the workflow that a user can directly execute with our workflow is to reproduce the figures from precomputed results (i.e. encoding model performance scores).

**Other aspects of the software engineering and scientific computing landscape.** We focused on what we believe are software practices that directly mitigate barriers to reproducibility in a research lab setting. In doing so, we did not discuss other aspects of reproducible research code such as data management [@tenopir_data_2020], workflow management [@wilkinson_applying_2025], licensing [@morin_quick_2012], software metadata [@chue_hong_fair_2022], containerization [@moreau_containers_2023; alser_packaging_2024], or cloud-computing [@berriman_application_2013].
We think these are important and exciting avenues for reproducible research and refer interested readers to cited references for further information about these aspects.

**Impacts of AI-assisted software development.** A common deterrent in adoption of software engineering practices in research that these are time-consuming.
Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI), computing systems that generate code from prompts given in natural language, are reshaping how software engineers and researchers produce and evaluate code. 
How will AI-assisted programming affect reproducible research?

At the time of this writing, the landscape is still evolving, confined to individual experimentation and prototyping.
In our work, the use of AI-assisted programming was left to individual setup of each author.
Our limited experience confirmed that AI-assisted programming reduced friction in specific tasks, such as writing docstrings.
While there are good reasons to think that judicious use of AI-assisted programming will facilitate aspects of reproducible work that are currently considered time-consuming [@dupre_future_2024], using unchecked outputs of an over-confident code generation system can lead to erroneous code [@krishna_importing_2025]. Given the broad technical, ethical, and legal challenges when it comes to the use of generative AI in science [e.g., @bommasani_opportunities_2022; @birhane_science_2023; @binz_how_2025; @choudhury_promise_2025, @charness_next_2025; @shumailov_ai_2024], it will require dedicated efforts of professional communities to establish sound practices in AI-assisted development for reproducible research.
